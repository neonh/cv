#### Software engineer with 9+ years' experience in automotive real-time embedded systems development and 6+ years' experience in computational physics: computer simulations, data analysis, automation tools development.


### EXPERIENCE

| **Developer** | [Kaspersky](https://kaspersky.com/), Moscow, Russia | March 2024 - Present |

Drivers development for KasperskyOS cyber immune operating system.


| **Lead software engineer** | [Itelma Electronics](https://www.itelma.ru/en/), Moscow, Russia | November 2014 - March 2024 |

Developed fast and highly reliable low-level embedded software for electronic control units (ECU) installed in new and existing cars, trucks and buses.

- Developed hardware abstraction layer (HAL) drivers (CAN, LIN, UART, ADC, GPIO, etc.) satisfying MISRA-C standard for PowerPC (SPC5), ARM Cortex-M (STM32 and analogues, S32K) and XC2000 microcontrollers, making it possible to reuse existing high-level algorithms on new ECUs thus increasing the development speed
- Developed configurable software for CAN gateway, reducing the time required to integrate the gateway into a new type of vehicle
- Designed and implemented interface to control electronic steering column lock (ESCL), that enabled new cars production to be launched in time
- Developed tools to automate software configuration, build and testing, resulting in faster release cycle time
- Maintained and expanded communication protocols realization (UDS, CCP, SAE J1939), meeting the requirements of the customers
- Implemented digital signature algorithm, that improved the security of ECUs
- Optimized checksum calculation function for XC2000, SPC5 microcontrollers, resulting in up to 5 times increased calculation speed
- Transformed legacy assembly code into platform-independent C code, simplifying the process of porting to the new microcontrollers


| **Researcher** | [Russian Quantum Center](https://rqc.ru/team/magnetoplasmonics-and-ultra-fast-magnetism), Moscow, Russia | June 2017 - Present |
